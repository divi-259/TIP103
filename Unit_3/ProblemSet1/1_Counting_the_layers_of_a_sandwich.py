You're working at a deli, and need to count the layers of a sandwich to make sure you made the order correctly. Each layer is represented by a nested list. Given a list of lists sandwich where each list [] represents a sandwich layer, write a recursive function count_layers() that returns the total number of sandwich layers.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

def count_layers(sandwich):
    pass
Example Usage:

sandwich1 = ["bread", ["lettuce", ["tomato", ["bread"]]]]
sandwich2 = ["bread", ["cheese", ["ham", ["mustard", ["bread"]]]]]

print(count_layers(sandwich1))
print(count_layers(sandwich2))
Example Output:

4
5

sandwich2 = ["bread", ["cheese", ["ham", ["mustard", ["bread"]]]]]
